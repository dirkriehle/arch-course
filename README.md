# Software Architecture (Project Module)

This course teaches students practical skills of software architecture using a single semester-long project. Usually, there are several projects, and content varies by project and by semester.

The general task is to document an existing architecture using the arc42 template, analyse and evaluate it for a defined purpose, and make suggestions for improvement. Again, the analysis purposes (security, performance, open source) vary.

This project module is based on the same-name course on software architecture (lecture + exercises). I started the course but it is now being run by Martin Jung of develop group; I believe his slides are not publicly available.
